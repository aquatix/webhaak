`webhaak`_ is a simple `webhook`_ service to update and deploy sites and do
other maintenance without having to ssh to a node.

`webhaak is on ReadTheDocs <https://webhaak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

webhaak supports ``git push`` hooks from GitHub, BitBucket, gitea, and gogs; for these it can automatically update checkouts. It also recognises Sentry notifications, and of course regular calls.


Installation
------------

From PyPI
~~~~~~~~~

Assuming you already are inside a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install webhaak

From Git
~~~~~~~~

Create a new virtualenv (if you are not already in one) and install the
necessary packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/aquatix/webhaak.git
    cd webhaak
    mkvirtualenv webhaak # or whatever project you are working on
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
-----

Copy ``settings.py`` from example_config to the parent directory and
configure to your needs. Create a yaml file with the projects to serve (see
next section) and refer to this file from the settings.py.

Run webhaak as a service under nginx or apache and call the appropriate
url's when wanted (e.g., on push to repository).

webhaak can also be run from the command line: ``uvicorn webhaak:app --reload``

Be sure to export/set the ``SECRETKEY`` environment variable before running, it's needed for some management URI's.

Run ``gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`` for production. For an example of how to set up a server `see this article <https://www.slingacademy.com/article/deploying-fastapi-on-ubuntu-with-nginx-and-lets-encrypt/>`_ with configuration for nginx, uvicorn, systemd, security and such.

The RQ background worker can be run from the command line: ``rq worker --with-scheduler``

Url's are of the form https://hook.example.com/app/<appkey>/<triggerkey>

API documentation is auto-generated, and can be browsed at https://hook.example.com/docs


Example configuration
---------------------

See the example `hook settings`_ for syntax of how to configure
repositories, commands and directories.

Call webhaak on its endpoint ``/admin/SECRETKEY/get_app_key`` to generate a random new key for
usage in the projects yaml file (so, for example https://hook.example.com/admin/abc123/get_app_key)

By default, webhaak clones projects in a directory under its
``REPOS_CACHE_DIR`` directory, but there is support for a per-repo parent dir
settings with ``repoparent`` in the yaml.

This means that webhaak then doesn't clone this repo into its default cache
dir, but in a subdirectory of the directory configured in ``repoparent``, so
<repoparent>/reponame (e.g., /srv/customparent/myproject).


Server configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `supervisord RQ worker`_ which uses the `RQ config`_
* `systemd for webhaak API`_ which uses the `gunicorn config`_
* `nginx for webhaak API`_
* `more config`_
